# Blur Markup Language (BML) Support for VS Code

This extension provides basic language support for the stochastic
markup language BML. Currently it provides syntax highlighting for
`.bml` files and a convenient "Run BML" command which executes the
active file.

## Requirements

This extension has no external dependencies, but new BML users may
want to install the language's package and command line interface
globally with `npm install -g bml` so they can use BML in the terminal
outside VS Code.
